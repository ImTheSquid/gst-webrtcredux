# WebRTC Redux
A revived version of GStreamer's webrtcbin, built with modern standards in mind.

This plugin provides a Rust API for Rust implementations. Support for C is planned.

Firefox and H264 support are not reliable and therefore their use is not recommended. Pull requests to fix these issues are welcome.
